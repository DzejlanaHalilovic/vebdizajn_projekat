                    <h2>Science</h2>
                    <p class="p">Teaching in the scientific category of the STEM program should look familiar and include biology,
                        ecology, chemistry and physics. However, a science class that focuses on your child's dentistry
                         it is not the kind of science class you can remember.
                       STEME's theoretical classes include technology, engineering and mathematics in scientific studies.
                       One of the projects is called "Stone Table".
                        A diet rich in minerals is important for health, and the minerals we take
                         from food are also found in the rocks. For example, iron is found in rocks,
                         and we take it into the body by eating eggs and fish, calcium is in addition to rocks
                         rich and dairy products, zinc nuts, etc. The children have the task of compiling a "menu"
                          strong as a rock ": based on the list of minerals found in foods, it will make its own
                           a healthy meal that includes at least one food for each mineral, and then that menu will
                            present and drawing. In this way, the child scientifically approached the concept of rocks by learning
                             their physical properties, then applied that theoretical knowledge in real life, and finally
                              it also launched its creative side by drawing its own solution.</p>

                    <h2>Engineering</h2>
                    <p class="p">For some parents, the closest thing to technology classes may be playing games
                        learning in mind during occasional computer lab sessions. Technological classes are
                        definitely changed and may include topics such as digital modeling and prototyping,
                         3D printing, mobile technologies, computer programming,
                         data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning and game development.
                         In this activity, children can begin to learn the basics of coding. This activity from ResearchParent offers suggestions on how to reduce activity
                          for younger children, as well as how to complicate it for elementary school students, and even for high school children.
                         With free print materials such as various mazes and instruction cards,
                          your child puts himself in the skin of the "user" and sets different codes (printed instructions) as
                           would "guide" his LEGO person through a maze. As children perform this activity, they learn to evaluate
                            perspective of something else and build a basic understanding of command codes, sequences and loops that
                            I can help them with the basics of coding later.</p>

                    <h2>Technology</h2>
                    <p class="p">Much like technology, the field and scope of engineers have grown significantly in the last few decades.
                        Engineering classes can include topics such as construction, electronics, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering
                        robotics - a topic many parents could not imagine learning in primary school.
                        A robot is not just a "tin man", it is any machine that works independently:
                         for example. a coffee and candy vending machine or a factory-made robot. The child will also learn
                         what materials robots are made of, what jobs they can do, what drives them and
                         how they are programmed to do a particular operation.
                        That scientific-theoretical knowledge about machines a child can apply in reality.
                        Here are great options for creative STEM learning. We've all seen fun stop-motion videos online,
                         but you probably never thought of making one yourself or, better yet,
                          with his children. With just a few items, a smartphone or iPadÂ® and
                          By stopping the movement, your children can learn about the technology that
                           stands behind making movies and to create a video unique according to their wishes and interests. </p>

                    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
                    <p class="p">Similar to science, math is one STEM category with classes that will sound familiar,
                        such as algebra, geometry and calculus. However, STEM math has two main differences from math
                         which parents remember. First, children learn more advanced mathematics at a younger age with introductory algebra and geometry
                         which begins in the third grade for some students in general, even those who are not enrolled in the STEM program. Secondly, it is small
                         similar to math, because you may have learned it. STEM mathematics includes concepts and exercises that apply science,
                         technology and engineering in mathematics.
                         With a sheet of paper glued to the wall, some sticky notes and a marker,
                          you can adjust this movement-oriented math activity to help
                           children to understand the meaning of numerical values. Instead of memorizing lists of numbers, this "game"
                           allows children to search for numbers on sticky notes and stick them on the wall over groups of dots
                            (or a star or sticker with bananas, if you like) that match the number.
                         Setting up for this activity couldn't be easier, and anyone with tape and paper can do it!
                         If your kids are still working on the concept - numbers 1-5 can be an easy place to start.</p>
